I work at a clinical-stage biotechnology company in oncology. Previously I have worked in healthcare and pharmaceutical industries in preclinical R&D, clinical oncology, real-world evidence, and revenue cycle management. I have also led data science teams at a global financial institution for anti-money laundering. I received my PhD in Computational and Systems Biology at MIT, with research in cancer clonal evolution and drug mechanisms of action and resistance. My interests are in areas of computational biology, genomics, oncology, AI/ML, fintech, and financial economic crime prevention.
