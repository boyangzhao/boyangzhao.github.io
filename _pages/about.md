I am a data science chapter lead and manager in financial crime analytics at ING Bank, N.V. I have also worked in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries in preclinical R&D and clinical and real-world evidence. I received my PhD in Computational and Systems Biology at MIT, with research in cancer clonal evolution and drug mechanisms of action and resistance. My interests are in areas of computational biology, genomics, machine learning, fintech, and financial economic crime prevention.
