I am a senior data scientist at ING Bank, N.V. I have also worked in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries in both preclinical and clinical areas. I received my PhD in Computational and Systems Biology at MIT, with research in cancer clonal evolution and drug mechanisms of action and resistance. My interests are in areas of computational biology, genomics, systems biology, finance, and banking.
