I work at a clinical-stage biotechnology company in oncology. Previously I have also worked in other healthcare and pharmaceutical industries in preclinical R&D, clinical oncology, and real-world evidence. I have also led data science teams in financial services in anti-money laundering. I received my PhD in Computational and Systems Biology at MIT, with research in cancer clonal evolution and drug mechanisms of action and resistance. My interests are in areas of computational biology, genomics, oncology, AI/ML, fintech, and financial economic crime prevention.
